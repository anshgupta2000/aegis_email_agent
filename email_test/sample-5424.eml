Finance/Remittance Department Director

Int'l. Wire Transfer/Telex Department,

International Monetary Fund,(IMF).

Contact email address:(kristalinageorggieva@gmail.com)





ATTN Beneficiary,





I hope this email meets you in good state of mind. Quite frankly, after a s=
erious thought, I have decided to personally reach you directly because I d=
o not have anything against you, but your so called representatives working=
 with you to realize the remittance of your payment. However, have you ever=
 wondered why you have been going this vicious circle over the past years w=
ith respect to having your fund paid to you without any success. It is poss=
ible that you were informed that your payment was brought to me for finaliz=
ation, neither were you informed that I am the person frustrating every mov=
e to get your fund remitted to your local bank account in your country, I c=
an assure you that this yet another deceit on the part of your representati=
ve(s).





Well, like I said earlier to you, I have nothing against you or your paymen=
t but I=92m only trying to protect my interest also. I do not want to menti=
on names here, but am certain you are aware of whom I am referring to havin=
g not received your funds.





I am the Finance/Remittance Department Director, International Wire Transfe=
r/Telex Department, International Monetary Fund (IMF) your funds conveyor. =
Sometime in the past a representative of yours approached me through a frie=
nd of mine who works with one of the Government Ministries here and request=
ed that I assist him conclude a money transfer deal having you as the benef=
iciary and we all agreed. According to him, he wanted to use this strategy =
to transfer a huge amount of US Dollars by presenting your name as Benefici=
ary Whose fund has not been paid.





Although we agreed that once i do that, he would give me 20% of the total f=
und and he will equally give me your contact information before I release t=
he fund to your account. When he saw that I have programmed your fund for o=
nward transfer and your name has been approved among the list of those to b=
e paid as instead of him letting me have your contact information to enable=
 me regulate the transfer of funds and confirm when it arrive in your accou=
nt to enable me send to you my private account details for my share of the =
20% as was agreed previously, what he did was to start avoiding me and whic=
h thereafter, resorted to threats, because of that, I immediately deleted y=
our payment initializing code (PIC) from the list of those to be paid, and =
this made it very IMPOSSIBLE for the transfer to be completed to your accou=
nt.





However, your local representative became very angry when he discoverer i w=
as able to truncate his illicit and deceitful plots and it could not work o=
ut as he wrongly wished. What he did was to start looking for other means o=
f trying to bribe other junior officers along with some other financial age=
ncies to see how they could assist him secure approval to enable them trans=
fer the money to you but all their efforts was to no avail. Is it not so fu=
nny my friend you as a beneficiary is being asked to pay several statutory =
fees over and over without your fund being transferred to you as well expec=
ted. Well, your fund is right here with us and am 100% responsible for the =
delay and obstructions of completing the transfer of funds to your account =
because of the breach of the gentleman agreement between me and your repres=
entative. If you doubt what I have just told you now, then go ahead and pay=
 any amount he may oblige you pay and thereafter, he will subject you into =
another form of tax payment and it goes on and o





(I). You must keep my information to you in this correspondence highly secr=
et because i don't want to get involve with him, I will have 10% of the mon=
ey if successfully transfers to your local bank account because it is only =
the two of us in connection to logical remittance of fund to you.





(ii). You MUST assure me you will not betray me at the end of a successfull=
y transfer of funds to your Local Bank Account and my own share will be saf=
e until when i direct you to lodged my part of fund into an account that i =
will forward to you.





(iii) As you have seen, it will be useless and mere waste of money if you c=
ontinue with your local representative and i can assure you that with trust=
 and confidence we will conclude the transaction with utmost secrecy and co=
nfidentiality if you wish to adhere to my directives and instructions. If t=
hese conditions are acceptable to you, contact me as soon as possible to le=
t us finalize all the arrangement and conclude the remittance of the fund t=
o you immediately without any other delay attached.





I will give you more important details once I hear from you based on if you=
 promise to keep away from your local representative and handle this matter=
 with utmost confidentiality because I want to transfer the money without t=
he knowledge of any other official of the bank or even without the knowledg=
e of your local representative.





May the peace of our Jesus Christ be upon you.





Faithfully Yours in Him.
