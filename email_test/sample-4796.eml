FROM THE DESK OF MR RICHARD PAUL,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER,
BANK OF AFRICAN B.O.A
COTONOU REPUBLIC.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/ europe/859479.stm
Email:mrprivatemrprivate2022@yahoo.com

Dear Friend,

TREAT AS URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL.

I am the manager of auditing and accounting at the foreign remittance depar=
tment of BANK OF AFRICAN) here in Cotonou, Benin Republic. In my department=
 we discovered an abandoned sum of US$5.350m dollars (FIVE MILLION, THREE H=
UNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND US DOLLARS). in an account that belongs to one of=
 our foreign customer (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany) who died=
 along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next o=
f kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless =
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indi=
cated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learn t that =
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the pla=
ne crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this busines=
s proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relati=
on to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is c=
oming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as u=
nclaimed bill, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury as uncl=
aimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occ=
asioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Benin-be cannot=
 stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the provisio=
n of a foreign account ,10% will be set aside for expenses incurred during =
the business and 60% would be for me Thereafter, I will visit your country =
for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Therefore, to enable=
 the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,you must apply first t=
o the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of applic=
ation that i will send to you,so i will like you to send to me your private=
 telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location=
 where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will sen=
d to you by fax or email the text of the application.

I will not fail to bring to your notice, this transaction is hitch-free and=
 that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangement=
s have been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately as soo=
n as you received this letter.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours Faithfully,
