Goodday, Please take your time to read this business proposal carefully. Firstly i will like to introduce myself. My name is Mrs Ren Yingxin and I am an employee at Bank of China in Hong Kong at the Private Banking Service department. I am contacting you regarding a customer investment placed under our banks management portfolio approximately 8 years ago. Kindly take all information on this email seriously. All i want is a honest and transparent business transaction with you.

  In January 2016, a businessman came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Service Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of $25 Million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case. I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to invest at our bank.

Unfortunately, in the year 2017, my client and his entire family was involved in a plane crash and unfortunately all passed on. Since his death I have made several inquiries to the USA embassy to attempt locate any of his extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. Thereafter my bank launched an official investigation aimed at locating possible surviving relatives or friends but to no success too. After these several unsuccessful attempts I decided to look for a next of kin that can stand in and claim this money. You being in another country and most importantly having same last name with the deceased...I think you will fit as a potential benefactor of the funds even if you are in no way affiliated or related with the deceased.

My official capacity dictates that I am the only person to supervise the investigation and the only person to receive the results of the investigation. What this means, with you being in another country, I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no identifiable family member. This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to normal practice, after all investigation has been done and there is no one to come forward and make claims, the funds will be left dormant and as a result of the protracted inactivity of the portfolio account and by the end of this current financial year a broadcast request is been made for statements of claims to our bank by the Hong Kong government, This will result in the money entering the Hong Kong government treasury. This will not happen if I have my way.

At this moment there is US$29,733,088.00 available balance including the interest accumulated over the years. I am the only person who has the deposit details and my bank will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. Here is my proposal, I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to officially release the deposit to you as the closest surviving associate to the deceased and all instructions shall be done in accordance with the rule of banking law, This project will be of great benefit to us. As a matter of fact, an attorney will be contracted to help re-validate and notarize all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim you make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law, We shall share the money 60%/40%.

If you find yourself interested to work with me, please do respond to my email, then I will initiate the process towards a quick conclusion. As you know, Honesty and transperacy is all we need right now to successfully accomplish this transaction. nothing ventured is nothing gained. Success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients, please do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I shall have the pleasure of meeting you, after this task has been completed.
Please contact me immediate via my private email (mrsrenyingxin@gmail.com) if you are interested to enable us proceed further.


Regards,
Mrs Ren Yingxin
